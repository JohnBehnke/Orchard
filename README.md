# Orchard

Orchard is a prototype macOS app designed to check the availability of specific products at nearby Apple Stores.

Products can be added by adjusting the `Products.json` file.

**Note** Orchard uses undocumented APIs found via inspecting the network requests on the Apple website. These could break at any moment without notice.
